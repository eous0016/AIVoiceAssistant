## 🔊 Overview

**TOM AI Voice Assistant** is a hands-free voice interface designed to enhance the driving experience for Grab’s driver-partners. While current AI assistants rely heavily on text-based interaction, this solution transitions towards a **voice-first** design — empowering drivers to interact naturally and safely, without needing to touch or look at their phones.

This project leverages the power of voice recognition, natural language understanding, and real-time response to enable safe, intelligent, and seamless interaction on the road.
